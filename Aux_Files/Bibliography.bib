However, the majority of skylights in historical spaces are not efficiently designed to adapt to public reuse and they uncover challenges in satisfying daylight requirements of potential visitors. This paper investigates a case of an old historical palace located in Cairo, Egypt, originally designed as a residence. The reuse purpose is a public museum where daylight plays an important experiential dimension, which makes it more challenging to adjust to the new daylighting conditions. In this study, adequacy of daylight is tested and verified with a developed comprehensive simulation model based on Daysim, for investigating the daily illuminance levels for fixed points on a 5×5 m grid. Comparative analysis is performed between simulation results and actual palace lux readings taken on the same created grid for the different skylight affected floor levels. Finally, the most significant skylight influential factors on the daylight performance are discussed for further skylight redesign with optimum performance.},

abstract = {Since the 1960s, gentrification has been confused with other urban notions such as upgrading and renewal, regardless of its economic and political perspectives, whereas it has been processing and evolving in urban neighborhoods, especially in the Western countries such as the USA and the UK, away from the developing countries. It took place also in other countries outside the core cities of gentrification. Researchers and urban planners agreed that to re-energize the study of gentrification is to focus on its ‘geographies' which are super-gentrification, third-world immigration—the global city, black/ethnic minority gentrification—race and gentrification, and livability/urban policy. To this point, the cultural diversity was omitted from the geography of gentrification, something that this paper will try to elaborate on and identify. Due to sociocultural differences between gentrification taking place in the developed world and that happening in the developing countries, the research suggests adding two new categories to the geographies of gentrification to reflect the specificities of Egypt. For instance, gentrification in Egypt is driven by other geographies of gentrification, namely historical-tourism gentrification and contracting/real estate gentrification. Thus, monitoring, observation, and analyzing of Heliopolis and Fatimid Cairo will be used to achieve the paper's main objective; to adapt the gentrification process with the Egyptian case studies, and to fill the gap in the gentrification literature regarding the geographies of gentrification in developing countries, the theme that will establish a new level of gentrification and open new field of research in Egypt. Therefore, urban planning will have a different valid scope in Egypt and provide decision makers with a new tool to develop and maintain the urban planning approaches in Egypt.},

abstract = {In school buildings, natural light has considerable physiological benefits, and increases energy efficiency while reducing the operational energy consumption of buildings. It is thus crucial to maximize the amount of daylight, as well as to improve its quality, in educational premises. In Italy and other European countries, many historic buildings are reused as school buildings, changing their original function. This process of adaptive reusing is one method for conserving heritage buildings, however sometimes this process sacrifices the quality of daylight and well being of pupils. It has therefore become apparent that it is difficult to reconcile the cultural value of historic buildings with comfort standards. This study aimed to investigate the natural lighting performance of a school located in an historic building, and proposes different technological solutions to improve the visual comfort in classrooms whilst also respecting the cultural value of built heritage. Daylight performance was carried out in a representative classroom in the 'Caserma Gaetano Abela', an historical building located in Siracusa (Italy). A daylight model built in Radiance was first validated against an illuminance measurement campaign, and was then used to run detailed dynamic simulations. Climate Based Daylight Modelling (CBDM) metrics were used to show the achievable improvements in visual comfort conditions by means of proposed retrofit interventions. These interventions may also be used in other areas of southern Europe with similar climatic and constructive/distributive characteristics of architectural heritage.},

Measured and simulated illuminances have been compared under 10,097 sky conditions in a full-scale test office with a double glazing and external venetian blinds. The additional planning effort for the designer compared to a conventional daylight simulation is addressed. It has been found that the treatment of direct sunlight strongly influences the accuracy of the daylight coefficient method. Three different simulation modes for the direct sunlight are investigated. The simulation results prove that indoor illuminances can be modeled with comparable accuracy for various blind settings under arbitrary sky conditions. Daylight autonomies are predicted with an accuracy below 2{\%} points, where simulation errors stem with roughly equal parts from the raytracing and the sky model. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A new capability that enables annual simulation of optically complex fenestration systems has been added to Radiance. The method relies on bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF) input data, which are used in an efficient matrix calculation to compute time-step performance given TMY data. The objective of this study was to explain the value of this capability to designers and developers of innovative daylighting systems and to demonstrate its speed and accuracy via comparisons of simulated to measured illuminance data for a daylight-redirecting optical louver system. The method was shown to provide valid results that accurately replicate real-world conditions with an absolute mean bias error below 13{\%} and a root mean square error below 23{\%}. Routine application of this new capability will not be hindered by slow computational speed for illuminance calculations. Instead, the capability will be dependent on the availability of BSDF data for daylighting, shading and fenestration systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

To be able to accurately represent the direct sun part of the daylight not only in sensor point simulations, but also in renderings of interior scenes, the 5-pm calculation procedure was extended. The validation shows that the 5-pm is superior to the Three-Phase Method for predicting horizontal and vertical illuminance sensor values as well as glare indices derived from rendered images. Even with input data from global and diffuse horizontal irradiance measurements only, daylight glare probability (DGP) values can be predicted within 10{\%} error of measured values for most situations.},

@article{Dervishi2012,
abstract = {For simulation-based prediction of buildings' energy use or expected gains from building-integrated solar energy systems, information on both direct and diffuse component of solar radiation is necessary. Available measured data are, however, typically restricted to global horizontal irradiance. There have been thus many efforts in the past to develop algorithms for the derivation of the diffuse fraction of solar irradiance. In this context, the present paper compares eight models for estimating diffuse fraction of irradiance based on a database of measured irradiance from Vienna, Austria. These models generally involve mathematical formulations with multiple coefficients whose values are typically valid for a specific location. Subsequent to a first comparison of these eight models, three better performing models were selected for a more detailed analysis. Thereby, the coefficients of the models were modified to account for Vienna data. The results suggest that some models can provide relatively reliable estimations of the diffuse fractions of the global irradiance. The calibration procedure could only slightly improve the models' performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Santos2018,
abstract = {This paper compares two different macroscopic light-redirecting fenestration systems (LRFS) using Radiance's three-phase method. The goal is to assess the potential of simplified daylight metrics that are less computationally expensive, such as Daylight Factor (DF), in the optimization of LRFS. This work compares a highly specular LRFS optimized for DF (Lasy{\_}S) with a validated commercial LRFS (LightLouver) using a Double Clear Glazing window as the control case. The comparison uses two different locations representative of two different annual sky conditions: London, UK - overcast; Phoenix, AZ, USA – clear. Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) and annual Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) are the metrics used to evaluate daylight availability and visual comfort. To facilitate the efficient modeling of customized macroscopic LRFS in the three-phase method workflow, this work extends Radiance's genblinds routine, making it able to generate complex venetian blinds systems based on multiple-curved sections. With the modified genblinds, the Lasy{\_}S system is properly remodeled for the three-phase method for an accurate comparison of the different systems. The analysis shows that Lasy{\_}S is a light-weighted and low-maintenance LRFS that outperforms LightLouver in terms of useful annual illuminance levels in both locations, being more effective in cloudier skies due to the metric used in the optimization. Nevertheless, albeit the system mitigates glare, it is not as successful as the commercial LRFS. This indicates that DF and annual horizontal illuminance metrics are unable to properly inform an optimization process on glare performance, thus being more appropriate for initial exploratory optimizations. Hence, to fully address glare, daylight optimization procedures based on DF should be complemented with more detailed glare simulations that do not require unreasonable computational resources.},

The tools rely on a three-phase matrix operation to compute solar heat gains, using as input low-resolution bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF) data (10–15° angular resolution; BSDF data define the angle-dependent behavior of light-scattering materials and systems). Measurement standards and product libraries for BSDF data are undergoing development to support solar heat gain calculations. Simulation of other metrics such as discomfort glare, annual solar exposure, and potentially thermal discomfort, however, require algorithms and BSDF input data that more accurately model the spatial distribution of transmitted and reflected irradiance or illuminance from the sun (0.5° resolution). This study describes such algorithms and input data, then validates the tools (i.e., an interpolation tool for measured BSDF data and the five-phase method) through comparisons with ray-tracing simulations and field monitored data from a full-scale testbed. Simulations of daylight-redirecting films, a micro-louvered screen, and venetian blinds using variable resolution, tensor tree BSDF input data derived from interpolated scanning goniophotometer measurements were shown to agree with field monitored data to within 20{\%} for greater than 75{\%} of the measurement period for illuminance-based performance parameters. The three-phase method delivered significantly less accurate results. We discuss the ramifications of these findings on industry and provide recommendations to increase end user awareness of the current limitations of existing software tools and BSDF product libraries.},

abstract = {Climate-Based Daylight Modelling (CBDM) gives designers the possibility to evaluate complex, long-term luminous environment dynamics. This complexity can be challenging to simulate, and even more challenging to communicate effectively through the use of performance metrics. A multiplicity of CBDM techniques and metrics has been developed over the last two decades, but these were rarely assessed against each other. This paper reviews four state-of-the-art techniques based on the Radiance raytracing engine and systematically compares them against a benchmark CBDM method. Four classroom spaces are used to carry out an inter-model comparison between performance metrics commonly used for compliance verification obtained from all analysed techniques. Additional sensitivity analyses assessed how changes in input variables influence such metrics. Results from the inter-model comparison showed that the representation of direct sunlight is markedly different between the various CBDM techniques, and that metrics based on horizontal direct sunlight are very sensitive to the choice of simulation method. This led to differences in predicted Annual Sunlight Exposure up to 39 percentage points. Metrics that consider both direct and inter-reflected light were found to be more robust, with variations from benchmark results within ±15{\%}. The analysis of the input variables showed that sensor grid spacing and time-step interpolation do not significantly affect any of these metrics. Changes in orientation and sky discretisation scheme had different effects depending on the metric and technique considered. The need for authoritative benchmarking systems when introducing new performance metrics for compliance verification or new simulation methods is also discussed.},

abstract = {For some locations both global and diffuse solar radiation are measured. However, for many locations, only global is measured, or inferred from satellite data. For modelling solar energy applications, the amount of radiation on a tilted surface is needed. Since only the direct component on a tilted surface can be calculated from trigonometry, we need to have diffuse on the horizontal available. There are regression relationships for estimating the diffuse on a tilted surface from diffuse on the horizontal. Models for estimating the diffuse radiation on the horizontal from horizontal global that have been developed in Europe or North America have proved to be inadequate for Australia [Spencer JW. A comparison of methods for estimating hourly diffuse solar radiation from global solar radiation. Sol Energy 1982; 29(1): 19-32]. Boland et al. [Modelling the diffuse fraction of global solar radiation on a horizontal surface. Environmetrics 2001; 12: 103-16] developed a validated model for Australian conditions. We detail our recent advances in developing the theoretical framework for the approach reported therein, particularly the use of the logistic function instead of piecewise linear or simple nonlinear functions. Additionally, we have also constructed a method, using quadratic programming, for identifying values that are likely to be erroneous. This allows us to eliminate outliers in diffuse radiation values, the data most prone to errors in measurement. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The presence of natural light in indoor spaces improves human health, well-being, and productivity, particularly in workplace environments. Do the social benefits of daylight translate into economic value as measured by what office tenants are willing to pay? Using a sample of 5154 office spaces in Manhattan, we pair urban daylight simulation with a hedonic valuation model to determine the marginal value of daylight in offices. Holding all other factors constant, we find that occupied spaces with access to high amounts of daylight (as measured by 55{\%} spatial daylight autonomy) have a 5–6{\%} value premium over occupied spaces with low amounts of daylight (as measured by less than 55{\%} spatial daylight autonomy). We simulate the distribution of daylight on each office floor individually, taking into account architectural and location-specific characteristics. Then, using the hedonic model, we determine the added value of daylight in the office spaces. The results show, for the first time, that an estimated 74{\%} of office spaces throughout Manhattan have low daylight, and that in a dense urban environment with differentiation in daylight levels, tenants value high daylight. Daylight value is independent of other building, neighborhood, and contract characteristics. By revealing the added value of daylight in commercial office spaces, we suggest that daylight is a key design driver and thus, should be considered in design, policy, planning, and project financing.},

Since global horizontal irradiance (GHI)is the most commonly measured solar radiation variable, it is advantageous for establishing a suitable method that uses it to compute DHI and DNI. In this way, a new model for predicting the diffuse fraction (Kd)based on the climate zone is proposed, using only the clearness index (Kt)as the predictor and 1-min resolution GHI data. A review of the literature on models that use hourly and sub-hourly Kt values to compute Kd was also carried out, and an extensive performance assessment of both the proposed model and the models from the literature was conducted using ten statistical indicators and a global performance index (GPI). A set of model parameters was determined for each climate zone considered in this study (arid, high albedo, temperate and tropical)using 48 worldwide radiometric stations. It was found that the best overall performing model was the model proposed in this work.},

@phdthesis{Abyad2017,
abstract = {The transformation of solar energy into electricity is starting to impact to overall worldwide energy production mix. Photovoltaic-generated electricity can play a significant role in minimizing the use of non-renewable energy sources. Sunlight consists of three main components: global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI) and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI). Typically, these components are measured using specialized instruments in order to study solar radiation at any location. However, these measurements are not always available, especially in the case of the DNI and DHI components of sunlight. Consequently, many models have been developed to estimate these components from available GHI data. These models have their own merits. For this thesis, solar radiation data collected at four locations have been analyzed. The data come from Al-Hanakiyah (Saudi Arabia), Boulder (U.S.), Ma'an (Jordan), and Ottawa (Canada). The BRL, Reindl*, DISC, and Perez models have been used to estimate DNI and DHI data from the experimentally measured GHI data. The findings show that the Reindl* and Perez model outcomes offered similar accuracy of computing DNI and DHI values when comparing with detailed experimental data for Al- Hanakiyah and Ma'an. For Boulder, the Perez and BRL models have similar estimation abilities of DHI values and the DISC and Perez models are better estimators of DNI. The Reindl* model performs better when modeling DHI and DNI for Ottawa data. The BRL and DISC models show similar metrics error analyses, except in the case of the Ma'an location where the BRL model shows high error metrics values in terms of MAE, RMSE, and standard deviation ($\sigma$). The Boulder and Ottawa locations datasets were not complete and affected the outcomes with regards to the model performance metrics. Moreover, the metrics show very high, unreasonable values in terms of RMSE and $\sigma$. It is advised that a global model be developed by collecting data from many locations as a way to help minimize the error between the actual and modeled values since the current models have their own limitations. Availability of multi-year data, parameters such as albedo and aerosols, and one minute to hourly time steps data could help minimize the error between measured and modeled data. In addition to having accurate data, analysis of spectral data is important to evaluate their impact on solar technologies.},

The study used several methods such as site visits, on-site measurements, surveying of architectural drawings, and statistical analysis of design data to examine existing case studies and extract information that helped identify building morphology configurations and define parameters to represent this building typology. The defined configurations helped develop the 3D geometry of the representative model in which the most dominant courtyard and exhibit room ranges were considered. Then, a comprehensive multi-scenario simulation process based on several climate-based daylight metrics under the UAE sky conditions was carried out to investigate lighting adequacy against potential risks on artifacts and visual comfort using several configurations of the developed model. The scenarios included different orientations with different window-to-wall ratios (WWR) of windows looking upon the courtyard using different configurations of the traditional verandah that helped shade the windows and reduce light exposure risks. The performance variables were analyzed against the recommended values/ranges by several international lighting standards. The study recommended several options to enhance the overall lighting environment and minimize risks on artifacts and visual comfort. This included better spatial arrangements, better designing and sizing of openings, and implementation of effective shading systems.},

Poor performance in that respect raised objections against the prestige of admirable works and famed artists. If we reject the absurd idea of accurately reproducing identical buildings in the same place repeatedly, how are we supposed to benefit from the said knowledge without the help of any objective design tools? It is easy to agree that at least we would need some scientific support to transmit such proper effects. Aware of the former notions, authors have developed a novel simulation software called DianaX, which is based on mathematical models and equations produced and expanded by Joseph Cabeza-La{\"{i}}nez, from roughly 1990 to 2018. This non-commercial software deals with radiative exchanges in all kinds of surfaces (for instance domes, vaults, cylinders, hyperboloids and curves in general). It also includes direct sun in the simulations unlike most programs. Therefore, it is ideally suited for the analysis of heritage architecture and especially that which identifies with the Renaissance, baroque and neoclassical epochs. The case of temples from the baroque period resumes the conflict expressed in the first paragraph and the Jesuit Church of Saint Louis (1699-1731) is one of the most relevant examples of efficient illumination found in Mediterranean latitudes, having been recently restored. In this article, we would like to discuss the subtle and interesting implications of employing our simulation software for lighting in such a complex baroque temple. The methodology would be to identify the main energy sources within the church in order to construct a suitable model for simulation. Subsequently we apply the said software DianaX to such model and establish the most significant results trying to compare them with available on-site measurements. Finally, a strategy to enhance day-lighting and supplement it with other light sources in the church is proposed.},

abstract = {Steep increases in air temperatures and CO2 emissions have been associated with the global demand for energy. This is coupled with population growth and improved living standards that encourages the reliance on mechanical acclimatization. Lighting energy alone is responsible for a large portion of total energy consumption in office buildings; and the demand for artificial light is expected to grow in the next years. One of sustainable approaches to enhance energy-efficiency is to incorporate daylighting strategies, which entail the controlled use of daylight inside buildings. Daylight simulation is an active area of research that offers accurate estimations, yet requires a complex set of inputs. Even with today's computers, simulations are computationally expensive and time-consuming, hindering to acquire accelerated preliminary approximations in acceptable timeframes, especially for the iterative design alternatives. Alternatively, predictive models that build on machine learning algorithms have granted much interest from the building design community due to their ability to handle such complex non-linear problems, acting as proxies to heavy simulations. This research presents a review on the growing directions that exploit machine learning to rapidly predict daylighting performance inside buildings, putting a particular focus on scopes of prediction, used algorithms, data sources and sizes, besides evaluation metrics. This work should improve architects' decision-making and increase the applicability to predict daylighting. Another implication is to point towards knowledge gaps and missing opportunities in the related research domain, revealing future trends that allow for such innovative approaches to be exploited more commonly in Architectural practice.},

abstract = {While daylight studies vary in scale and complexity, they follow almost identical procedure that yields higher spatial and temporal dimensionality of luminance/illuminance values, which should be reduced into simpler performance metrics. Several complexities arise from depending solely on performance metrics that do not neither agree on unified thresholds, nor report luminous variations spaces might experience due to weather fluctuations. Few research attempts addressed those issues using predefined timesteps. However, they capture instantaneous performance samples of spaces to which they can only be applied, considering fractions of sky conditions that do not offer generalization. This research expands previous endeavors and presents an unprecedented approach that employs unsupervised machine learning to characterize the most representative temporal settings of given locations from widely accessible weather datasets to evaluate internal luminous conditions. The strengths of three algorithms are combined: the ability of Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality, with Self-Organizing Maps and K-means to cluster the reduced data. To exemplify the proposed approach, three locations are investigated, expressing diverse sky conditions. Each of which reflected unique clustering patterns that were translated into temporal profile maps for visualization. This would provide architects and policy makers with methodology to facilitate building performance simulation and design.},

abstract = {Daylighting is recognized as an important element in architecture and a useful strategy in energy-efficient building designs. Daylight gives a sense of cheeriness and brightness that can have a significant positive impact on the people. There is a scope for integrating daylight with electric light to reduce building energy use. The amount of daylight entering a building is mainly through window openings, which create in the indoor environment a more attractive and pleasing atmosphere, in addition to maximise visual access to the pleasant views of the outside world. Determinations of the exterior and interior daylight and lighting energy savings are key issues to demonstrate the benefits based on daylighting designs. This paper provides a review of daylight illuminance determinations and the lighting energy reductions due to daylighting schemes. The study includes daylight measurements, prediction of daylight illuminance under various sky conditions and potential electric lighting energy savings from daylight-linked lighting controls. The article aims at providing building professionals, practitioners and researchers more information and a better understanding of daylight for promoting effective daylighting designs and evaluations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we therefore propose a research framework for the development of BPS tools conformed to fit common design practice in the early design stage. The proposed framework was constructed based on review of existing research methodologies in the area of BPS for informing decisions in the early design stage, and on review of methodologies used in other research fields, such as design research, social science, software development, and innovation research. The proposed research framework consists of four elements: 1) a reflective researcher who navigates the research activities and reflect on research methods, approaches and outcome; 2) a framing of the research to identify relevant theme, topic and research question of interest; 3) an iterative workflow procedure of planning, acting, observing and reflecting to generate a spiral of understanding, inspired by action research; and 4) a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods and approaches from the related research fields that could be applied continuously to seek and refine different solutions. The paper also reports on an application example which demonstrated that the framework is a helpful tool for systematic navigation and documentation of research activities and collection of data. Furthermore, the iterative nature of the framework continuously increases the researchers understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the design practice in early design stage enabling them to make better proposals for BPS tools that are conformed to fit common design practice in the early design stage.},

abstract = {The absence or improper use of shading on the glazing of building windows causes overheating which increases both cooling load and glare, especially in the hot desert climate. However, integrating Daylighting Systems appropriately into building windows can contribute to reducing energy consumption by effectively utilizing daylight as a renewable resource instead of depending only on artificial light. This can help in achieving green, sustainable, high performance, and energy-efficient buildings. This paper proposes a set of integrated Daylighting Systems into building windows to optimize the energy efficiency performance of office buildings in the hot desert climate. The integration of individual and collective Daylighting Systems with different configurations are explored to generate an extensive set composed of 87 alternatives in three different orientations. The energy simulation is conducted for these alternatives to investigate their performance on reducing the electric energy consumption of cooling and artificial lighting. The optimal set of energy-efficient integrated Daylighting Systems is determined based on the highest performance of reducing energy consumption for cooling and lighting while maintaining visual and thermal comfort. This optimal set of integrations is formulated into a multi-level utilization guide for facilitating the appropriate selection of optimal energy-efficient Daylighting Systems into building windows. This utilization guide will assist building designers to optimize the energy efficiency performance of buildings by selecting the most appropriate Daylighting Systems to be integrated into building windows. Such performance-based utilization guide will aid designers in making decisions from the perspectives of energy efficiency, and visual and thermal comfort.},

Both instrumentations were tested in the field during different campaigns exposures. After exposures between 90 and 100 days, these dosimeters showed photo-induced colour changes which translated exposures into equivalent luminous exposure and estimated annual exposures (Lux hours) which were used to validate the measured values of illuminance data. Simulated light dosimeters and measured illuminance data show good correlation.

Measurements were taken for eight of the nine fabric designations documented in the ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals. Measurements were also obtained for a sheer fabric which does not fall into any of the customary fabric designations. Semi-empirical models were developed to quantify the variation of solar optical properties with respect to incidence angle. Given solar optical properties obtained at normal incidence, these models can be used to characterise the off-normal beam-beam and beam-diffuse properties of a drapery fabric. The fabric models comprise a useful component of pleated drapery models and, in turn, a valuable tool for building energy simulation.

abstract = {Mass and number concentration of particulate matter (PM10) was measured during walking experiments inside a laboratory. In total 20 walking experiments were conducted in a period of 3 months. Particle number concentration was measured in the size range of 0.02-1 ??m, while, mass concentration was measured in the range 0.1-10 ??m. The PM10 mass increased during the activity, by average 84\%, whereas, the walking activity had no impact on particle number concentration. Human induced resuspension rates were examined under different dust loadings. The different dust loadings used (25, 15, 5, 1 g/m2) in order to evaluate the impact of surface loading on the indoor PM10 mass concentration and on the resuspension rate. Walking style was the same in all experiments. Moreover, the experiments involved two different walking patterns inside the laboratory (rectangular and line). The impact of different speed was also examined. The average resuspension rate was calculated to be equal to 10-2-10-3 hr-1. No impact on resuspension rate was observed for different walking patterns or walking speed. On the other hand, the measured mass concentration inside the room was increased when using higher dust loading on the floor, although the estimated resuspension rate found independent on the initially deposited surface dust loading.},

abstract = {This work investigated the resuspension and subsequent translocation of particulate matter (PM) from carpeted flooring surfaces due to walking. In addition, the effect of HVAC systems and ceiling fans on mixing and/or translocation of resuspended PM was studied. Testing took place both in a residence with a well-worn, soiled carpet and in an environmental test chamber. Prescribed walking occurred with PM measurements taken at multiple sampling heights. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of carpet fibers was used to determine the fraction of dust available for resuspension. These data, in conjunction with resuspended mass concentrations from this study, were used to generate emission factors by particle size for walking on both new and worn carpet. Carpet loading does not affect the emission factor, indicating that the amount of resuspended PM is directly proportional to the available PM in the carpet. While relative humidity (RH) plays an important role in resuspension from new carpets, with high RH enhancing resuspension, it has the opposite affect with old carpets, with increased RH decreasing resuspension. With the HVAC system on, translocated particles 1.2 m horizontally from the source had number concentrations of approximately 20-40\% of those at the source. With a ceiling fan on, extensive mixing was noted with little difference seen in particle resuspension by height. With the ceiling fan off, there was very little mixing present and particle size varied substantially by height. Copyright {\textcopyright} American Association for Aerosol Research.},

abstract = {Chemical compounds such as arsenic, mercury and organochlorine pesticides have been extensively used as preventive and curative conservation treatments for cultural and biological collections to protect them from pest and mould infestations. Most of the aforementioned compounds have been classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic and represent a health risk for staff exposed to contaminated objects. A total of 30 compounds were analysed in settled dust, particulate matter and surrounding air collected at several locations in the natural history collections and adjacent rooms of the Museum f{\"{u}}r Naturkunde, Berlin (MfN, Natural History Museum, Berlin, Germany). Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques were used to quantify dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (2,4′-DDT; 4,4′-DDT) and their metabolites (2,4′-DDE; 4,4′-DDE; 2,4′-DDD; 4,4′-DDD), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 3 isomers of hexachlorocyclohexanes ($\alpha$-HCH, $\beta$-HCH, $\gamma$-HCH), the degradation product of $\gamma$-HCH with similar toxicological profile, gamma-pentachlorocyclohexene ($\gamma$-PCH) and pentachlorophenol (PCP). Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to analyse arsenic and mercury. In order to assess the pathways of contamination with biocides in dust, formations of particulate matter during individual daily work activities, particle number concentrations (PNCs) were measured. Heavy element concentrations found at the MfN were higher than the organochlorine compounds. The maximum concentration of arsenic and mercury in dust was 3507 mg/kg and 32 mg/kg, respectively, and in air, 48 ng/m3 and 1.6 ng/m3, respectively. The maximum concentration of the sum of DDTs in dust was 2 mg/kg (not detected in air); for PCP, the maximum levels in dust and air were 0.65 mg/kg and 10 ng/m3, respectively; for $\gamma$-HCH, 130 mg/kg and 320 ng/m3, respectively; and finally, for $\gamma$-PCH, 2.1 mg/kg and 230 ng/m3, respectively. Twelve PNC measurements were obtained from seven different collection rooms and the diaries of the participants' activities. PNCs were highly variable between work activities. Higher personal PNCs were associated with activities like opening storage boxes with prepared animals, reading old books or handling objects. This study has shown that taxidermic objects in museum collection may be a cause for arsenic exposure during handling of objects.},

abstract = {Particle deposition to indoor surfaces is frequently modeled by assuming that indoor air flow is homogeneously and isotropically turbulent. Existing formulations of such models, based on the seminal work of Corner and Pendlebury, lack a thorough physical foundation. We apply the results of recent studies of near-surface turbulence to produce an analogous model for particle deposition onto indoor surfaces that remains practical to use yet has a stronger physical basis. The model accounts for the effects of Brownian and turbulent diffusion and gravitational settling. It predicts deposition to smooth surfaces as a function of particle size and density. The only required input parameters are enclosure geometry and friction velocity. Model equations are presented for enclosures with vertical and horizontal surfaces, and for spherical cavities. The model helps account for a previously unexplained experimental observation regarding the functional dependence of deposition velocity on particle size. Model predictions agree well with recently published experimental data for a spherical cavity.},

abstract = {Indoor air quality recently entered legislation in Portugal. Several parameters must be evaluated and kept within limits in order to obtain a certification for air quality and energy consumption. Certification parameters were analyzed in two Portuguese archives in order to assess indoor air quality both for people attending or working on these premises and for maintenance of a written heritage that must be retained for future generations. Carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde, and fungal counts were kept within stipulated limits. Relative humidity (RH), volatile organic compounds (VOC), particulate matter (PM10), and ozone (O3) showed values above legislated levels and justified the implementation of corrective measures. In terms of conservation, studies on the limit values are still needed, but according to the available international guidelines, some of the analyzed parameters such as PM10, O3, and RH were also above desirable values. Corrective measures were proposed to these institutions. Although this study was only of a short duration, it proved valuable in assessing potential eventual problems and constitutes the first Portuguese indoor air quality assessment taking into consideration both aspects of an archive such as human health and heritage safekeeping.},

Monitoring volatile pollutants in museum microclimates remains an unusual practice in most institutions. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be released by many sources, including the artefacts' materials themselves. The presence of pollutants in an enclosed space with poor ventilation, adding to high temperature and relative humidity levels or significant fluctuations, may increase the risk of damage for the more susceptible materials. The tendency observed in museums to enclose artefacts in vitrines or boxes may contribute to the formation of microclimates with high VOCs concentration. Based on the studies developed in the last decades, this work intends to draw attention to the risks associated with gaseous pollutants in museum environment and outline some recommendations that encourage cultural heritage institutions to implement a pollutant monitoring plan associated with risk prevention.},

The three cultural heritage sites were located in different environments [coastal (Heraklion), urban (Athens) and mountainous (Zagori)], and their collections consist mainly of organic materials. Particulate mass size distribution measurements (PM10) (cut-off diameters at 10, 9, 5.8, 4.7, 3.3, 2.1, 1.1, 0.7 and 0.4 $\mu$m) were performed inside the museums in conjunction with measurements of viable, cultivable microorganisms in air (heterotrophic bacteria, autotrophic chemolithotrophic bacteria, bacteria with metabolizing capabilities for exhibited organic materials, gelatin hydrolyzing bacteria, acid producing bacteria and fast growing fungi). The particulate matter measurements showed a variability, which was related to outdoor particle concentrations, indoor environmental conditions, infiltration rates and to indoor activities. The PM2.1 fraction of the PM10 mass had a value close to 0.6 indicating a significant outdoor origin. Chemical analysis (ions, carbonaceous material and metals) of particulate matter revealed that ions and organic carbon comprised the major part of the particle mass. Elevated concentrations of Fe, Al-rich and soluble particles were measured indoors in the three sites. An enrichment of bacteria with metabolizing capabilities for bone, parchment, woolen fabric, gelatin, and cellulose was encountered indoors in the cultural heritage sites studied as well as inside closed showcases. An indication of seasonal variations of the airborne microbial load was observed in the three cultural heritage collections. In addition, there were differences in the measured microbial load, indoors, inside the showcases and outdoors.},

In most sampling days, daytime/nighttime particle mass ratios in Exhibition Hall (1.30-3.12) were higher than those in Pit No.1 (0.96-2.59), indicating more contribution of the tourist flow in Exhibition Hall than in Pit No. 1. The maximum of particle size distributions were in a range of 0.5-1.0 $\mu$m, with the highest abundance (43.4\%) occurred in Exhibition Hall at night. The majority of airborne particles at the Museum was composed of soil dust, S-containing particles, and low-Z particles like soot aggregate and biogenic particles. Both size distributions and particle types were found to be associated with visitor numbers in Exhibition Hall and with natural ventilation in Pit No.1. No significant influence of visitors on indoor temperature and relative humidity (RH) was found in either display halls. Those baseline data on the nature of the airborne particles inside the Museum can be incorporated into the maintenance criteria, display management, and ventilation strategy by conservators of the museum. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Objects in Southern California museums may become perceptibly soiled within periods as short as a year due to the deposition of airborne particles onto their surfaces. Methods for reducing the soiling rate include reducing the building ventilation rate, increasing the effectivenes of particle filtration, reducing the particle deposition velocity onto surfaces of concern, placing objects within display cases or glass frames, managing a site to achieve low outdoor aerosol concentrations, and eliminating indoor particle sources. A mathematical model of indoor aerosol dynamics and experimental data collected at an historical museum in Southern California are combined to illustrate the potential effectiveness of these control techniques. According to model results, the soiling rate can be reduced by at least two orders of magnitude through practical application of these control measures. Combining improved filtration with either a reduced ventilation rate for the entire building or low-air-exchange display cases is a very effective approach to reducing the soiling hazard in museums. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

The impacts of storey, particle size and decorative flooring on particle characteristics inside museum were investigated. Size fractionated PNC in display halls belonging to the same storey exhibited similar daily variations. Particles within the range of 0.3–0.5 µm were identified as the most significant contributors to the overall size distribution measured, as ambient fine particles penetrated through the mechanical ventilation system. Multi-lognormal fitting OC concentrations can be assigned to the presence of tourists in the museum or originate from secondary OC formation. The latter can be estimated by comparing the relationship between OC and EC, as well as OC and WSOC.},

Rich decorations of this former printing-house and the history of the building itself underline its uniqueness. The cultural heritage (CH) objects collected in the museum, in particular books and manuscripts are vulnerable to the atmospheric pollution and can be irreversibly damaged. To assess the air quality inside the museum, four consecutive sampling campaigns were performed in each season of the year. The gas monitoring of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and ozone (O 3) was carried out outside the building, in galleries and in showcases by means of using diffusive samplers. The particulate matter (PM) was collected in bulk form and as single particles and then analysed with use of energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) and electron probe micro-analyser (EPMA), respectively. The museum complex turned out to show good protection against gaseous pollutants, especially SO 2 and O 3. The concentrations of these pollutants were significantly reduced inside the building in comparison to the outdoor ones. Similar protective character of the museum complex was established in case of the coarse fraction of PM; however with some limitations. Single particle analysis showed that the relative abundance of carbon-rich particles inside the museum was greater than outside. Moreover, these particles contributed more to the fine fraction of PM than to the coarse fraction. Therefore, for better preservation of cultural heritage, special attention should be paid to the small particles and their distribution within the museum. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Chatoutsidou2019,
abstract = {The impact from the indoor dry deposition of size-resolved particles was investigated in the present study. Published data from a baroque library in Prague, two medieval churches in Cyprus and two historical churches in Poland were used in the present study. Values of the deposition velocity vd obtained in literature from these studies were used to examine the comparative impact on the preservation of indoor collections in relation to particle size and indoor concentrations. The number of deposited particles was estimated at different particle sizes for cases where number concentration data were available whilst the mass flux towards indoor surfaces was obtained from the particle mass size distribution. Additionally, a dose-response function was implemented to investigate the acceptable level of soiling regarding the aesthetic impact from the deposition of indoor particulate matter. The results demonstrate that higher number of deposited particles are found in the lower part of the size distribution (fine particles), whereas, an opposite behavior was obtained for the mass flux where higher flux was obtained for coarse particles. These findings were directly associated with indoor particle dynamics at the different sizes and the corresponding concentrations. Particularly, higher accumulation on indoor surfaces by fine particles was linked with a relative effect of these particles for deposition on vertical-oriented surfaces whereas the large amount of deposited mass arising from coarse particles was attributed to a potential impact on horizontal surfaces. Furthermore, the dose-response function showed a proportional relationship between the soiling constant and the PM10 concentration, with indoor sites characterized by elevated concentrations being more risky for the preservation of indoor works of art. In general, the results of the present study highlight the necessity of a common assessment of the indoor particle size distribution and the corresponding chemical composition for better analysis of the effect due to dry particle deposition.},

abstract = {Museums, historical buildings mainly located in urban centers, may be seriously affected by pollution and other critical urban atmospheric conditions. In addition to museums, there are many other different cultural heritage indoor environments each having different characteristics, mainly depending on the type of preserved materials that are sensitive to pollution and urban conditions. In this contribution we report an investigation of the indoor air quality and some considerations about the conservation of historical artifacts located inside the Historical Museum of Bersaglieri in Rome. Specifically, we show the feasibility in the exhibition rooms of a microclimatic characterization to evaluate the air quality, a critical issue for many of the artifacts exposed in confined spaces. The work we carried out is the monitoring of the behavior of temperature and relative humidity and the presence of airborne pollutants inside the museum halls. Taking into account the regulations in force that control and protect the Italian museums, these measurements have been carried out by using a customized and flexible system based on low-cost multi-parameter sensors allowing the monitoring of several environmental parameters. In spite of the limitation of this preliminary test study, on the basis of the results and according to the different preserved materials, a set of indications, criteria and tools have been provided to the museum managers to implement an effective "conservative strategy".},

@article{Camuffo1996,
abstract = {This paper describes the principal results of two field surveys carried out in the historic Anatomy Theatre of the University of Padua to monitor the microclimate, the daily thermohygrometric cycles and the deposition of airborne pollutants. Daily and seasonal cycles in ambient temperature and relative humidity induce changes in the wood moisture content which result in strain-induced stresses which may generate distortional strains or fracture. Deposition of airborne pollutants causes disfiguring soiling and may damage wood by producing hydrolysis (acids) or dissolving lignin and hemicellulose (alkalis); or by forming iron salts near nails. The microclimate monitoring campaigns were undertaken during two periods at the extremes of the seasonal cycle, i.e. in mid-winter (February) and the height of the summer (July). Also the daily trend of the spectral size distribution of the airborne paniculate matter was recorded by means of a particle counter based on the theory of Mie on the diffraction of light operated by suspended particles. Particularly important were the exchanges of heat and air through the windows, the convection currents induced by the electric lamps, and the re-suspension of large particles disturbed when people walk. During the summertime, the daily cycles of relative humidity are responsible for a dangerous shrinking and swelling of the wooden structure. Problems and possible remedies are outlined in the conclusions. {\textcopyright} 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

The measured indoor aerosol characteristics agree well with predictions of a mathematical model of indoor aerosol dynamics based on measured outdoor aerosol characteristics and building parameters. At all three sites, the fraction of particles entering from outdoor air that deposit onto surfaces varies strongly with particle size, ranging from a minimum of 0.1–0.5\% for particles having a diameter in the vicinity of 0.15 $\mu$m to greater than 90\% for particles larger than 20 $\mu$m in diameter. Deposition calculations indicate that, at the rates determined for the study days, enough elemental carbon (soot) would accumulate on vertical surfaces in the museums to yield perceptible soiling in as little as 1 year at one site to as long as 10–40 years at the other two sites. {\textcopyright} 1990, American Chemical Society.

The rate of deposition of dust in surfaces is presented as the result of the combination of two main factors: the concentration of suspended particles close to surfaces, and their capacity to deposit, expressed as the deposition velocity. We suggest that either of these two factors can be altered in order to mitigate deposition. The implications of this perspective are explored using in-situ measurements in a historic property (Apsley House, London) and a computational fluid dynamics model of aerosol deposition. The cases studied involve the effect of outdoor wind on the ingress of particles, the consequences of leaving the main door open, and the effects of the ventilation system on deposition. The results demonstrate that simulations can be used reliably to explore hypothetical scenarios or situations that would be experimentally challenging. The inputs and outputs of the computational model are discussed in view of its usability in preventive conservation.},

The collected samples were analyzed gravimetrically, by Ion Chromatog. (IC) and Particle Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE) giving mass, ionic, and elemental size distributions. Simultaneously, total suspended particles (TSP) were collected on quartz filters, that were later analyzed for elemental (EC) and org. carbon (OC). In addn., indoor and outdoor gaseous ammonia and nitric acid were measured using passive diffusion samplers. Typical mass size distributions were bimodal with the min. at about 1 $\mu$m, with lower concns. indoors and submicron range shifted to smaller particles. The results of IC revealed that ammonium sulfate and nitrate form about 30\% of outdoor and about 20\% of indoor mass of submicron fractions of PM, with indoor nitrate concns. decreasing to zero. Most of the ammonium nitrate evapd. after penetration indoors probably due to higher indoor temps. and fast surface deposition of gaseous nitric acid.

More specifically, the increase of metal concentrations in particulate matter during the summer of 2018 and spring of 2019 in the museum under investigation could possibly be associated with the microclimates of both seasons, with coastal factors, as well as with the anthropic activities specific to the port of Constanta. FTIR and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) techniques, used for the investigation of PM2.5-10 samples, revealed high concentrations of Fe, Al-rich, and soluble particles inside the investigated museum area. In this respect, the chemical measurements of the PM2.5-10 masses highlighted high concentrations of heavy metals (i.e., Al, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Pb) and low concentrations of trace metals (i.e., Cr, Ni, Cu, and Cd). Statistical analysis showed that the chemical compositions of the particulate matter in the indoor and outdoor areas of the Roman Mosaic Edifice were influenced by microclimatic conditions, mainly temperature and relative humidity (RH). A potential health risk for tourists is the thermal and humid conditions, alongside the toxic components of the particulate matter. This research seeks to provide solutions for improving the environmental conditions inside the Roman Mosaic Edifice and to offer useful suggestions concerning health promotion and the protection of museum exhibits against possible future deterioration.},

@article{Grau-Bove2016,
abstract = {In this work, we use a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to simulate the penetration, dispersion and deposition of particulate matter (mean particle size of 2.5 $\mu$m) in a historical house. We compare the simulation results with direct measurements of deposition in several rooms and with measurements of concentration in different conditions of wind direction. The computational model, based on the drift-flux approach, provides accurate predictions of the spatial distribution of deposition and the variation of the indoor/outdoor ratio, which display a good agreement with experimental measurements. Our analysis shows that while the ingress rate of particles is controlled by wind direction and pressure, the amount of particles that reaches every surface depends ultimately on the operation of the ventilation system. Concentration indoors is relatively homogeneous, however, the spatial arrangement of the rooms and the position of air inlets and outlets results in significant gradients of deposition rates, which has direct implications for cleaning and preservation. These findings illustrate the potential of CFD to produce meaningful predictions of yearly and monthly deposition in large, multi-room environments, and to offer site-specific evidence, which can inform heritage managers and enable risk assessment.},

Results showed that fine particles were deposited predominantly on the surface of the top filter but partly also on the surfaces of inner filters. It indicates fine particles penetrated between filters. The penetration and deposition of particles was also modelled as Brownian diffusion between two parallel filters. The model prediction demonstrated that fine particles penetrate between filters, with the depth of penetration limited by parallel diffusional deposition on filter surfaces. This is in qualitative agreement with SEM and IC investigations. The results show that beside the top part fine PM can deposit onto all available surfaces of books. {\textcopyright} 2013 Smolik et al.; licensee Chemistry Central Ltd.},

@article{Nazaroff1990a,
abstract = {Deposition of airborne particles may lead to soiling and /or chemical damage of objects kept indoors, including works of art in museums. Measurements recently were made of the deposition velocity of fine particles (diameter range: 0.05–2.1 $\mu$m) onto surfaces in five Southern California museums. In this paper, theoretical predictions of particle deposition velocities onto vertical surfaces are developed for comparison against the experimental results. Deposition velocities are calculated from data on surface-air temperature difference and near-wall air velocity using idealized representations of the air flow field near the wall. For the five sites studied, the wall-air temperature differences were generally in the range of a few tenths to a few degrees Kelvin. Average air velocities measured at 1 cm from the wall were in the range 0.08–0.19 m s−1. Based on a combination of modeling predictions and measurement results, the best estimate values of deposition velocity for the wall studied at each site are obtained. These values are in the range (1.3–20) × 10−6 m s−1 for particles with 0.05–$\mu$m diameter and (0.1–3.3) × 10−6 for particles with 1-$\mu$m diameter. The range of 15–30 in deposition velocity for a given particle size is due primarily to differences among sites in the near-wall air flow regime, with the low and high values associated with forced laminar flow and homogeneous turbulence in the core of the room, respectively. {\textcopyright} 1990 Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc.},

@article{Maskova2015,
abstract = {To determine the composition of particulate matter (PM) in the indoor environments of four different types of archives (three naturally ventilated and one filtered), intensive size-resolved sampling was performed for four seasons of the year. For reconstituting indoor PM, nine aerosol components were considered. Organic matter was the dominant component of both fine and coarse fractions and represented approximately 50-80\% of the PM. In the fine fraction, the next most abundant components were elemental carbon and sulphate, and in the coarse fraction the next most abundant were crustal matter, sulphate and nitrate. The resulting mass closure explained 95(±13)\% and 115(±38)\% of the gravimetric indoor PM in the fine and coarse size fractions, respectively. The results revealed that all the particles found indoors can be considered to be potentially threatening to the stored materials. The results also showed that the most important source of indoor PM in the naturally ventilated archives was penetration from the outdoor air, whereas in the filtered archive, the concentrations of particles were strongly reduced. In naturally ventilated archives the influence of domestic heating, road traffic and local sources (industrial pollution, camp fires) was observed. Furthermore, activities of the staff were identified as an indoor source of coarse particles in all archives.},

The extent of soiling was determined by means of two independent methods: (1) in terms of the covering rate of the samplers by optical reflection microscopy and (2) the reduction in lightness of the samplers using the CIE L*a*b* color space by spectrophotometry. A fairly good correlation was found between both methods. The inorganic composition of the deposited water-soluble TSP was quantified by means of ion chromatography. Compared to controlled environments, uncontrolled environments showed increased water-soluble aerosol content of the total deposited mass. Higher chloride deposition was observed on horizontal surfaces, compared to vertical surfaces.},

The PM1 (fine) and PM10 (coarse) fractions of the dust particles from archival repositories were collected on cellulose filters Whatman 41, polytetrafluorethylene, and quartz filters. The latter two types of samples were subsequently analyzed gravimetrically, with ion chromatography, PIXE, and the thermal–optical transmission method, giving mass, ionic, elemental carbon, and organic carbon concentrations. After artificial aging, the viscosity-average degree of polymerization of cellulose (DPv) was measured. It was confirmed that cellulose-based paper can undergo substantial changes when contaminated by dust particles and artificially aged. The decrease of the DPv of cellulose showed a negative correlation with the deposited mass of sulfate ions in the dust particles. Considering the particle size fraction, the results suggest the decisive importance of the fine (PM1) particles. The results provide better understanding of how particulate matter contributes to the chemical degradation of cellulose-based paper. Such knowledge is of importance when considering appropriate conservation measures in archives, libraries, and galleries.},

The naturally ventilated system of the building, the restriction of personnel access, reduced groups of visitors and absence of activities which could influence indoor pollutant concentrations are characteristics that make the Baroque Library Hall a suitable location to study the influence of outdoor environment on the indoor air quality. The relationship between indoor and outdoor (I/O) concentration was investigated to assess the infiltration of outdoor generated pollutants. Outdoor and indoor pollution sources were determined and, infiltration of ammonium nitrate and a shift of the equilibrium to the gas phase were the reason for the high concentration of ammonia measured inside the BLH. A significant seasonal variation was observed and interpreted as a consequence of different infiltration regime associated with indoor-outdoor temperature differences, which in addition drives dilution processes of indoor generated pollutants.

abstract = {In the present paper total suspended particulate matter (TSP) was collected at the S. Marco Museum in Florence during seasonal monitoring campaigns carried out in 2013 and 2014. The analyses focused on the determination of TSP chemical composition: main ions, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble organic compounds (WSOC) and levoglucosa which is considered the specific marker for wood burning. The analysis of TSP composition in Florence historical centre is of interest to assess what the damage caused to the surfaces of the urban monumental heritage could be. TSP higher value has been registered during December 2013 (58,6 $\mu$g/m3 ± 7,3 $\mu$g/m3) while the lower value has been registered in July 2013 (28,5 $\mu$g/m3 ± 2,2 $\mu$g/m3). OC and EC were also higher in winter with respect to summer. Sulphate is characterized by quite constant values during all the examined periods while ammonium and nitrate were higher in winter. The seasonal contribution of different sources such as combustion processes (from traffic and wood burning) and soil dust resuspension has been evidenced. In particular during winter a high concentration of levoglucosan, the specific marker for wood combustion, has been determined. Finally, all the data obtained were correlated with those previously determined in another study carried out in 2003 at the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Florence in order to evaluate any possible change in the atmospheric pollution composition.},

@article{Mleczkowska2017,
abstract = {The particle concentrations outside and inside two historical churches were monitored for at least ten months. The highest levels of outdoor concentrations were recorded in winter. This was caused by high levels of particle emissions from the burning of predominantly solid fuel for domestic heating in premises around the two churches monitored. These high levels of particle concentrations declined over the warmer periods of the year with the lowest concentrations occurring in the summer months. Owing to the marked winter–summer pattern for outdoor concentrations, the particles of outdoor origin accounted for 80\%–90\% of the overall indoor particle concentrations in the period of predominantly cold weather conditions (December to March) and for 50\%–60\% in the warm period (June to September). Reducing air exchange between the external space and the church interiors by keeping windows and doors closed had a limited effect on the reduction of average particle concentrations indoors (by less than 10\%). A controlled air exchange system, which would increase the ventilation of a church when the particle concentration outdoors is lower than indoors and reduce ventilation when the outdoor air is polluted, would produce a further reduction of 10\% in the indoor average particle concentration. The general conclusion is that the protection of the interiors of historical churches against soiling is primarily achieved by the improved particle filtering capacity of building envelopes and the gradual reduction of the overall outdoor particle concentration. Use of air cleaning systems with particle filtration may be a viable long-term option.},

For this reason, the atmosphere in proximity of the Florence Baptistery, located in the city centre, was continuously monitored during 2003 and 2004 by means of aerosol sampling performed close to two of the three doors of the monument. In particular, the monitoring was performed close to the North Door, realized by Lorenzo Ghiberti (1403-1424), currently utilized as the entrance to the monument, and the South Door, a masterpiece of Andrea Pisano (1330), employed as the exit for visitors. The sampling sites were characterized by different expositions to road traffic emissions. The non-carbonate carbon and soluble ionic components of the total suspended matter were measured. The data obtained is presented and discussed with the goal of contributing to the formulation of guidelines for a suitable safeguard of the built cultural heritage. {\textcopyright} 2009 WIT Press.},

abstract = {Fine particulate matter is, on account of its aerodynamic properties and typical composition (especially diesel particulate matter and carbonaceous particles) the particulate pollutant potentially most harmful to cultural heritage, representing an aesthetic issue and an agent of chemical degradation simultaneously. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the life-cycle of fine particulates, focussing on diesel particulate matter from emission to deposition, including its aesthetic and chemical consequences, and draws attention to some imbalances in the current state of research. The currently available measurements are biased towards coarse dust, and information on the consequences of particle deposition is largely restricted to the outdoor environment. More evidence on the chemical effects of the most common types of fine particulate matter in typical indoor materials is needed to enable risk assessment for indoor collections. {\textcopyright} 2013 Grau-Bov{\'{e}} and Strli{\v{c}}; licensee Chemistry Central Ltd.},

@article{Maskova2020,
abstract = {Indoor air pollution in archives can cause irreversible degradation of materials stored there. Thus, detailed information about indoor air quality is essential before control strategies could be investigated. In a period 2008–2019, the relationship between the indoor and outdoor pollution was investigated in four naturally ventilated archives located in historical buildings and situated in regions with different outdoor air quality. The indoor and outdoor particle number, mass, and chemical size distributions were measured during different seasons. Moreover, air change rates (a), penetration coefficients (P), and deposition velocities (Vd) were determined. The results revealed that the most important source of the indoor particulate matter was the outdoor air. The size-resolved data with no indoor sources were evaluated using the steady-state solution of the mass balance equation as the I/O ratio. The results showed that all parameters (a, P, and Vd) determined in archives were comparable with low seasonal variation, probably due to the similar building characteristics. Further, the typical average values of the I/O ratio for naturally ventilated historical buildings were estimated. Finally, the long-term indoor concentrations, for periods when no measurement was in place, were determined using data from the local monitoring network. The results showed that the higher level of pollution and therefore the higher degree of degradation is expected in depositories located in highly polluted regions.},

The dust accumulated in the repositories of the NAI was composed of heavy and light particles, most probably of inorganic and organic origin. Its colour was black, while that found in libraries located in small cities was brown and almost completely inorganic. The dust of metropolitan cities was sticky while that of small cities was not. The rate of dust accumulation during the year was highly dependent on the rainfall, being highest in the dry summer and lowest during the rainy period July-September. The total dust accumulated in the repositories of the NAI varied in different stack areas from 6.07 to 7.14 mg/m2 per annum. These numbers are alarming. Advice is given as to how they can be reduced.},

abstract = {Particle sources and deposition inside two historical churches, differing in size and construction were examined. The particle concentrations indoors and outdoors were monitored for at least 10 months. The air exchange rate (AER) was determined by fitting an exponential decay curve to the recorded concentration of indoor-generated CO2. The two-parameter mass balance equation, taking into account the particle sources and sinks in the indoor environment of churches, was used to determine the particle deposition velocities and penetration factors. Large indoor and outdoor particle concentration variability helped to separate the effects of penetration and deposition losses. For example, liturgical services regularly generated high indoor particle concentrations, owing to the burning of incense. During the particle concentration decay after the services, losses due to deposition could be reliably determined, whereas the events of high outdoor aerosol concentrations with no emission of particles indoors allowed the penetration factors to be precisely determined. The minimal AER values of 0.1 and 0.3 h-1 were observed in the closed brick and wooden church, respectively. Typically, area-averaged deposition velocities for particles of diameters 0.3-1 $\mu$m or above 1 $\mu$m were 1.5{\textperiodcentered}10-5 and 2.1{\textperiodcentered}10-5 m/s, respectively, and were very consistent between the two churches studied in spite of the differences in their design, size, construction materials and pattern of use. Penetration factors ranged from 0.7 to 0.86.},

@article{Chen2011,
abstract = {Epidemiologic evidence indicates a relationship between outdoor particle exposure and adverse health effects, while most people spend 85-90\% of their time indoors, thus understanding the relationship between indoor and outdoor particles is quite important. This paper aims to provide an up-to-date revision for both experiment and modeling on relationship between indoor and outdoor particles. The use of three different parameters: indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratio, infiltration factor and penetration factor, to assess the relationship between indoor and outdoor particles were reviewed. The experimental data of the three parameters measured both in real houses and laboratories were summarized and analyzed. The I/O ratios vary considerably due to the difference in size-dependent indoor particle emission rates, the geometry of the cracks in building envelopes, and the air exchange rates. Thus, it is difficult to draw uniform conclusions as detailed information, which make I/O ratio hardly helpful for understanding the indoor/outdoor relationship. Infiltration factor represents the equilibrium fraction of ambient particles that penetrates indoors and remains suspended, which avoids the mixture with indoor particle sources. Penetration factor is the most relevant parameter for the particle penetration mechanism through cracks and leaks in the building envelope. We investigate the methods used in previously published studies to both measure and model the infiltration and penetration factors. We also discuss the application of the penetration factor models and provide recommendations for improvement. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The study presents a new procedure for identifying possible risks for books kept in historic libraries. It is addressed to all those historic libraries where large collections of old and rare books are stored and preserved. These libraries were rarely used by people, but, nowadays, many of them have become touristic attractions. Consequently, their indoor microclimate may have changed, possibly leading to risks for books conservation. The proposed methodology is based on an intensive monitoring campaign, followed by an in-depth data analysis. Handy indices are also proposed to guide the researchers in the identification of possible risks. Problems related to too-high daily or spatial hygrothermal variations or problems related to specific risks (e.g., biological or chemical risks) can be identified. If a problem is observed, the identification of the most suitable solutions is more straightforward. The application of the proposed procedure to a real case study (the Baroque Library of the University of Coimbra, Portugal) has highlighted its handiness. A 6-month monitoring campaign and its consequent data analysis has pointed out potentially risky situations. Thus, measures should be taken to avoid books damage. Primarily, local actions are suggested.},

Different pollutants were measured inside and outside the museum such as inorganic gases, particulate matter and black carbon. The report specifically addresses environmental factors that may be responsible for damage to the collections present in museums.

The basic principle involved is that of conservation of mass (of both air and tracer gas) as expressed in the continuity equation; by monitoring the injection and concentration of the tracer, one can infer the exchange of air. This report will summarize the techniques in use. Although there is only one continuity equation, there are many different experimental injection strategies and analytical approaches.

@article{Huerto-Cardenas2020,
   abstract = {The proper simulation of the hygrothermal behaviour of historical buildings is a challenging task with several implications regarding the evaluation of indoor thermal comfort and the suitability of retrofit strategies that comply with the conservation of cultural heritage. An inaccurate simulation may lead to inadequate conclusions, which could result in inappropriate and dangerous actions for the preservation of the heritage buildings. Then calibration and validation of hygrothermal simulation models are essential steps to achieve more accurate and reliable results. Now, although some agencies have developed guidelines and methodologies to carry out the validation of building performance models, all of them are based on energy consumption only. However, since in some buildings the energy consumption data are not always available especially when no operating heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is installed, which is the case of many historical buildings, the microclimatic parameters are usually adopted in the validation process. In this case, neither protocols nor specific parameters have been officially recognised to perform the model validation. The present work reviewed the main approaches used by researchers for building performance model validation with special reference to historical buildings based on microclimatic parameters, highlighting the main advantages and drawbacks of the different methods reviewed. Finally, recommendations to properly carry out the model validation based on microclimatic parameters have been provided. The collected information may be useful to different subjects (e.g. designers, energy auditors, researchers, conservators, buildings’ owners and policy makers) and can drive suitable and reliable retrofit and maintenance interventions.},

   abstract = {The calculation of building energy consumption is needed in all architecture design projects. Building simulation software is used to predict the indoor air temperature and relative humidity as well as the building's heat loads. The calculation of accurate heat load requires calculating coupled heat and moisture transfer in building envelopes and the hygrothermal interactions between the envelopes and the environment. However, the moisture effects of building envelopes are often neglected. This would bring much inaccuracy to the simulation results. Based on different calculation methods, many numerical building energy simulation programs have been developed. This paper evaluates the accuracy and the applicability of three thermal models in EnergyPlus (CTF-Conduction Transfer Function model, HAMT-Combined Heat and Moisture Transfer model, EMPD-Effective Moisture Penetration Depth model) for calculating moisture effects on building energy consumption in different climate conditions. The effects of different room infiltration rate on the accuracy of different models are also analyzed.},
