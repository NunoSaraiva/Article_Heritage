\section{Materials and Methods}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly avail-able database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

In this section, where applicable, authors are required to disclose details of how gen-erative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has been used in this paper (e.g., to generate text, data, or graphics, or to assist in study design, data collection, analysis, or interpretation). The use of GenAI for superficial text editing (e.g., grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting) does not need to be declared.

\section{Results}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.
\subsection{Subsection}
\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

Bulleted lists look like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item	First bullet;
\item	Second bullet;
\item	Third bullet.
\end{itemize}

Numbered lists can be added as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	First item; 
\item	Second item;
\item	Third item.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Schemes}

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure~\ref{fig1}, Table~\ref{tab1}, etc.

\begin{figure}[H]
%\isPreprints{\centering}{} % Only used for preprints
\includegraphics[width=4.0 cm]{Definitions/logo-mdpi}
\caption{This is a figure. Schemes follow the same formatting.\label{fig1}}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[H] 
%\small % Change table font size
\caption{This is a table caption. Tables should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are~cited.\label{tab1}}

\end{tabularx}

\noindent{\footnotesize{\textsuperscript{1} Tables may have a footer.}}
\end{table}

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\end{adjustwidth}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.

%% Example of a page in landscape format (with table and table footnote).
%\startlandscape
%\begin{table}[H] %% Table in wide page
%%\isPreprints{\centering}{} % This command is only used for ``preprints''.
%\caption{This is a very wide table.\label{tab3}}
%	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{CCCC}
%		\toprule
%		\textbf{Title 1}	& \textbf{Title 2}	& \textbf{Title 3}	& \textbf{Title 4}\\
%		\midrule
%		Entry 1		& Data			& Data			& This cell has some longer content that runs over two lines.\\
%		Entry 2		& Data			& Data			& Data\textsuperscript{1}\\
%		\bottomrule
%	\end{tabularx}
%%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
%	\begin{adjustwidth}{+\extralength}{0cm}
%%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.
%		\noindent\footnotesize{\textsuperscript{1} This is a table footnote.}
%%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
%	\end{adjustwidth}
%%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.
%\end{table}
%\finishlandscape

Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
The text continues here.
